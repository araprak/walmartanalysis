# Data-Driven Insights into Walmart Sales


The code provided is a project on the data analysis of Walmart monthly sales. The goal of this project is to understand the trends in Walmart sales and to identify factors that influence sales.

Data

The data used in this project is from the Walmart Open Data Challenge. The data includes weekly sales data for Walmart stores across the United States, as well as data on temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment.

Methodology

The following steps were taken to analyze the data:

1. Exploratory data analysis: This involved summarizing the data and creating visualizations to understand the overall trends and patterns in the data.
2. Hypothesis testing: This involved using statistical tests to test hypotheses about the relationship between sales and other factors, such as temperature, fuel price, and CPI.
3. Forecasting: This involved using machine learning models to forecast future sales.

Results

The following are some of the key findings from the analysis:

1. Weekly sales vary significantly across stores.
2. Weekly sales are higher during holiday weeks.
3. Weekly sales are positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with fuel price.
4. There is a statistically significant difference in sales between holiday and non-holiday weeks.

Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the trends in Walmart sales and the factors that influence sales. This information can be used by Walmart to make informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and inventory management.
